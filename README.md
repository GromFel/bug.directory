## What Is It?
bug.directory is a searchable Obsidian vault brought to you by the [exploits.club](https://exploits.club) team. It's intended to serve as a collection of vuln research, exploit development, and reverse engineering resources to help you get spun up on new projects fast. 

The database has been initially seeded with weekly resources collected in https://blog.exploits.club. **That said, the vault is [open-source](https://github.com/exploits-club/bug.directory) and thus the more contributions from the community the better.**

## How To Use It?

### Online:
The *easiest* way to get spun up is check out some of the tags linked below, or use the search bar to find something specific (platform, primitive, resource, etc). That said, there are limitations with the way Obsidian Publish handles tagging on the web sooo üëá
### Locally
The vault *really* shines when used locally with Obsidian - It was designed with graph view in mind, which isn't as fully featured on the web platform (WIP - see [[Index#How To Get Involved? | How To Get Involved]]). You can clone a copy from our [GitHub](https://github.com/exploits-club/bug.directory)

## Some Tags To Get You Started:
#linux #chrome #windows #lpe #fuzzing #learning_resource #ctf
## How To Get Involved?
1. The organization so far has been the brain child of a few people..okay really just *one person*. As such, please submit pull requests for new tags to be added, missing tags on resources, or new resources all together. A formal contribution guide is coming for non-exploits.club resources, but for now checkout out [templates/Submission.md](https://github.com/exploits-club/bug.directory/blob/main/templates/Submission.md)
2. Obsidian Publish leaves...something to be desired - this vault is really intended to be searched in the graph view as shown in the local view. As such, we are working on a self hosted version of this site which is a little more user friendly. If this is of interest and you can center a div, reach out to info@exploits.club.
